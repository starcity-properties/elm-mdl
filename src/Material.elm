Material Design component library for Elm based on Google's
[Material Design Lite](https://www.getmdl.io/).

for a live demo.

This module contains (a) documentation about overall usage and API principles of
elm-mdl and (b) functions for suppressing TEA boilerplate. For a "Getting started"
guide, refer to [the
README](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/README.md#get-started).


# Using the library.

## Interfacing with CSS

This library depends on the CSS part of Google's Material Design Lite. Your app
will have to load that. See the
[Scheme](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Scheme)
module for exposing details. (The starting point implementations above
load CSS automatically.)

## Color theming

Material Design defines a color palette. The
[Color](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Color)
module contains exposing various `Property` values and helper functions for working with
this color palette.

## View functions

The view function of most components has this signature:

    view : (Msg -> m) -> Model -> List (Property m)  -> List (Html m) -> Html m

It's helpful to compare this signature to the standard one of `core/html`, e.g.,
`Html.div`:

    div  :                        List (Attribute m) -> List (Html m) -> Html m

1. For technical reasons, rather than using `Html.App.map f (view ...)`, you
provide the lifting function `f` directly to the component as the first
argument.
2. The `Model` argument is standard for TEA view functions.
3. The `List (Property m)` argument can be thought of as an alternative
to `List (Html.Attribute)`. You customise the behaviour of elm-mdl components
by supplying these `Property m`, much the same way you set attributes of
  `Html.div`. See the
  [Options](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/debois/elm-mdl/latest/Material-Options)
  module for details.
4. The `List (Html m)` argument is standard: it is the contents of the component,
  e.g., the text inside a button.

NB! If you are using parts to suppress TEA boilerplate, call `render` instead
of `view` (see below).

# Suppressing TEA boilerplate

The component model of the library is simply the Elm Architecture (TEA), i.e.,
each component has types `Model` and `Msg`, and values `view` and `update`. A
minimal example using this library as plain TEA can be found
[here](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component-TEA.elm).

Using more than a few component in plain TEA is unwieldy because of the large
amount of boilerplate one has to write. This library uses the
[Parts mechanic](https://github.com/debois/elm-parts) suppress most of
  that boilerplate. A minimal example using parts is
[here](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm).

It is important to note that parts is not an alternative to TEA; it is simply
a library which hides much of the tedious TEA boilerplate.


## Required boilerplate

The present module contains only convenience functions for working with nested
components in the Elm architecture. A minimal example using this library
with component support can be found
[here](http://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/examples/Component.elm).
We encourage you to use the library in this fashion.

Here is how you use elm-mdl with parts. First, boilerplate.

 1. Add a model container for Material components to your model:

        type alias Model =
          { ...
          , mdl : Material.Model
          }

        model : Model =
          { ...
          , mdl = Material.model
          }

 2. Add an action for Material components.

        type Msg =
          ...
          | Mdl (Material.Msg Msg)

 3. Handle that message in your update function as follows:

        update message model =
          case message of
            ...
            Mdl message' ->
              Material.update message' model

 4.  If your app is using Layout and/or Menu, you need also to set up
 subscriptions and initialisations; see `subscriptions` and `init` below.

You now have sufficient boilerplate for using __any__ number of elm-mdl components.
Let's say you need a textfield for name entry, and you'd like to be notifed
whenever the field changes value through your own NameChanged action:

        import Material.Textfield as Textfield

        ...

        nameInput : Textfield.Instance Material.Model Msg
        nameInput =

        view addr model =
          ...
          Textfield.render [0] Mdl model.mdl
            [ css "width" "16rem"
            , Textfield.floatingLabel
            , Textfield.onInput NameChanged
            ]

The win relative to using plain Elm Architecture is that adding a component
neither requires you to update your model, your Msgs, nor your update function.


## Optimising for size

Using this module will force all elm-mdl components to be built and included in
your application. If this is unacceptable, you can custom-build a version of this
module that exposing uses only the components you need. To do so, you need to provide your
own versions of the type `Model` and the value `model` of the present module.
Use the corresponding definitions in this module as a starting point
([source](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl/blob/master/src/Material.elm))
and simply comment out the components you do not need.

## Parts API

-}

import Dict
import Platform.Cmd exposing (Cmd)

import Parts exposing (Indexed)
import Material.Helpers exposing (map1st, map2nd)

import Material.Button as Button
import Material.Textfield as Textfield
import Material.Menu as Menu
import Material.Snackbar as Snackbar
import Material.Layout as Layout
import Material.Toggles as Toggles
import Material.Tooltip as Tooltip
import Material.Tabs as Tabs
--import Material.Template as Template


{-| Model encompassing all Material components. Since some components store
user actions in their model (notably Snackbar), the model is generic in the
type of such "observations".
-}
type alias Model =
  { button : Indexed Button.Model
  , textfield : Indexed Textfield.Model
  , menu : Indexed Menu.Model
  , snackbar : Maybe (Snackbar.Model Int)
  , layout : Layout.Model
  , toggles : Indexed Toggles.Model
  , tooltip : Indexed Tooltip.Model
  , tabs : Indexed Tabs.Model
--  , template : Indexed Template.Model
  }


{-| Initial model.
-}
model : Model
model =
  { button = Dict.empty
  , textfield = Dict.empty
  , menu = Dict.empty
  , snackbar = Nothing
  , layout = Layout.defaultModel
  , toggles = Dict.empty
  , tooltip = Dict.empty
  , tabs = Dict.empty
--  , template = Dict.empty
  }


{-| Msg encompassing actions of all Material components.
-}
type alias Msg obs =
  Parts.Msg Model obs


{-| Update function for the above Msg. Provide as the first
argument a lifting function that embeds the generic MDL action in
your own Msg type.
-}
update :
     Msg obs
  -> { model | mdl : Model }
  -> ({ model | mdl : Model }, Cmd obs)
update msg model =
  Parts.update' msg model.mdl
    |> Maybe.map (map1st (\mdl -> { model | mdl = mdl }))
    |> Maybe.withDefault (model, Cmd.none)


{-| Subscriptions and initialisation of elm-mdl. Some components requires
subscriptions in order to function. Hook these up to your containing app as
follows.

    import Material

    type Model =
      { ...
      , mdl : Material.Model
      }

    type Msg =
      ...
      | Mdl Material.Msg

    ...

    App.program
      { init = ( model, Material.init Mdl )
      , view = view
      , subscriptions = Material.subscriptions Mdl
      , update = update
      }

Currently, only Layout and Menu require subscriptions, and only Layout require
initialisation.
-}
subscriptions : (Msg obs -> obs) -> { model | mdl : Model } -> Sub obs
subscriptions lift model =
  Sub.batch
    [ Layout.subs lift model.mdl
    , Menu.subs lift model.mdl
    ]


{-| Initialisation. See `subscriptions` above.
-}
init : (Msg obs -> obs) -> Cmd obs
init lift =
  Layout.sub0 lift
